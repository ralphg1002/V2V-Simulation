The vehicular network simulator, VANET toolbox, is a Simulink library.  The library contains major vehicular network layers, APP layer, MAC layer and PHY layer. 

APP layer is responsible for message generation and vehicular mobility models. Currently, APP layer generates messages including Basic Safety Message (BSM) and Lane Changing Message.  The mobility models include the car-following model (CFM) and lane-changing model (LCM), thus users can simulate braking and changing lane behaviors. 

MAC layer implemented Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) according to IEEE 802.11p. The messages entity 0from APP layer is converted into frame entity, experience channel contention period and sent to PHY layer as waveform entity.  On the other hand, the waveform received from the PHY layer is converted into payload and sent to the APP layer.  The MAC layer also supports Relible Data Transmission (RDT), i.e., DATA-ACK. 

PHY layer includes a two-ray ground reflection model and an AWGN channel based on WAVE/DSRC standards. The Tx/Rx and AWGN are developed based on IEEE 802.11a and implemented by WLAN system toolbox. 

VANET Toolbox provides three options to create a simulation model:

1. Build Simulink models. One can create a Simulink model by dragging the needed blocks from VANETlib. Example models are provided, please check the files starting with 'demo_';

2. VANET toolbox provides a basic GUI for users to conduct simulations in batches. To open the GUI, type 'vanet' in MATLAB command window and tune up the necessary parameters. 

3. GUI only has limited options, while the Simulink model is limited in a large-scale simulation. In order to simulate with all tunable parameters in large scale, simulations need to be created by MATLAB script. Please refer to 'simLC.m' for more details.
